Our team at Future Foundry was brought on to implement the designs for the goal driving app, Fulfyll.

We built the app in React Native for iOS and the server using Rails. I was mainly responsible for the development of the API but contributed to the React Native side a fair amount.

### Responsibilities and Tasks included:

- Building the entire REST API for the application on Rails as well as an admin panel.
- Building two separate authentication systems: one around the API itself then another around the Admin panel.
- Coordinating with our React Native developer regularly as well as contributing to the styling of the React Native side.
- Having regular check-ins with our clients and making meaningful changes and additions in accordance with their feedback.
